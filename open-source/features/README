# The features folder also is the name of the top feature, you can
# put the name into PRODUCT_REVISION, and add include $(APPLY_PRODUCT_REVISION)
# to gather them in product lunch entry.

# FOR EXAMPLE:

# The device sp9830aea_5m_h100 device which define its lunch entry in
# device/sprd/sp9830aea_5m_h100/sp9830aea_5m_h100.mk, now he wants to
# gather oversea features, you can do action as follow:

# 1. Fork a new product makefile lunch entry from sp9830aea_5m_h100.mk,
#    you can named it as sp9830aea5mh100oversea.mk. And the "fork" means
#    you should inherit configurations from sp9830aea_5m_h100.mk by
#    "include device/sprd/sp9830aea_5m_h100/sp9830aea_5m_h100.mk"
# 2. Add PRODUCT_REVISION := oversea and include $(APPLY_PRODUCT_REVISION)
#    after include the product configuration you last inherited
